# Advent of Code 2021 - Day 1

## Part 1

AoC 2021 started off with a pretty straightforward challenge. I could have probably put this into a one-liner as an arrow function, but I'm trying to break my habit of over-relying on anonymous arrow functions.

Part two was just an extension of part 1, but doing a sliding scale. I spent most of my time today getting the repo set up. I'm lazy so I want to make sure that I can have a template to start new days with.

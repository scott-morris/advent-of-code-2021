# Advent of Code 2021 - Day 9

## Part 1

Another 2-dimensional array / matrix problem. I'm beginning to feel like I should start writing some matrix helper functions like I did with `src/helpers/math.js`. It would be helpful because I keep making the stupid mistakes of transposing my logic (thinking in `x,y` when a 2 dimensional array is referenced as `[y][x]`).

Through a couple rounds of stepping through the code with breakpoints, I got it. 

## Part 2


## Other Thoughts

I really want to add some documentation that describes the code itself, maybe with some sort of walkthrough. Ideally, I'd like to try out a tool like [CodeHike](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike#how-to-set-up-code-hike)
